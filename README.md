## Introduction

Electricity is a crucial resource worldwide, and understanding its usage and generation patterns is essential for energy planning and policy-making. This project aims to offer a detailed analysis of global electricity data, providing valuable insights for researchers, policymakers, and energy enthusiasts.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Fetch and preprocess electricity data from various reliable sources.
- **Data Analysis**: Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and trends.
- **Visualization**: Create informative visualizations to present insights effectively.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Perform statistical tests and modeling to derive meaningful conclusions.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Develop predictive models for electricity consumption and generation.
- **Geospatial Mapping**: Visualize electricity data on interactive maps.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Examine time series data for forecasting and trend identification.
